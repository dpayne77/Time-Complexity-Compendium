			<p>The Time Complexity Compendium is aimed at late-high school or early undergraduate Computer Science students who already have some 
				programming experience (such as Programming Fundamentals 1 or similar). The course is designed to
				give students an introduction to Time Complexity and and Big O Notation.
				Most importantly, the course teaches students how to analyze the time complexity of algorithms under various circumstances, such as loops, recursion, and data structures.

					The mini-course is a <strong>Self-paced</strong> course. This means that students can complete the modules at their own pace according to their understanding of each topic. Since modules build on each previous topic, it is highly recommended that students take and pass the summative evaluation assessment at the end of each module before moving on to the next, even though all modules are unlocked from the start. Because this course is online, students can always reference and review previous modules if they fail to understand a certain topic.
				</p>
				<p>
					We recommend students spend approximately 1 hour per day on this course for approximately 2 school weeks, doing about 1 module per day. However, students can complete the course at their own pace.
				</p>
				<p>
					There are 7 modules, each intended to take approximately 45 minutes, including the summative evaluation assessment. The modules will be a mix of instructional content via paragraphs, diagrams, visuals, and code examples. Interspersed between the instructional content will be mini-activities that check the student’s understanding of the content that came before it. These activities give students the opportunity to think critically about content and reinforce learning by allowing them to apply what they have learned. At the end of each module, there will be a summative evaluation assessment consisting of questions related to the module.

			<p>
				You will not need to download extra software for this course, nor do you need to create an account to start learning. All you need is an internet connection and a browser.
			</p>
			<p>
				You can access the course on any device that has a web browser, including desktops, laptops, tablets, and smartphones. The course is designed to be responsive, meaning that it will automatically adjust to the size of your screen. This means that you can take the course on any device, no matter the size of the screen.
			</p>
			<p>
				It is recommended that students are familiar with the C++ programming language, as the code snippets in this course will be written in C++. The course will not delve deep into C++ syntax, but students should know the syntax for variable declarations, for loops, while loops, and recursive functions for this course. For students unfamiliar with C++, the website <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/cpp/">w3schools.com/cpp/</a> would be a good place to start learning this syntax.

				<p>
					In every module, there is an activity or multiple activities that students can complete to further reinforce their understanding of the content. Students are encouraged to complete them to further their learning.
				</p>
				<p>
					At the end of each module, there will be a self-evaluation assessment consisting of questions related to the module. The summative evaluation assessment will be a mix of multiple choice, true/false, and short answer questions. The summative evaluation assessment will be graded automatically, and students will be able to see their score immediately after submitting the assessment with feedback. Students will be able to retake the summative evaluation assessment as many times as they want, and the highest score will be recorded.
